abstract = {The Galileo spacecraft was launched by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989. A two-stage Inertial Upper Stage propelled Galileo out of Earth parking orbit to begin its 6-year interplanetary transfer to Jupiter. Galileo has already received two gravity assists: from Venus on February 10, 1990 and from Earth on December 8, 1990. After a second gravity-assist flyby of Earth on December 8, 1992, Galileo will have achieved the energy necessary to reach Jupiter. Galileo's interplanetary trajectory includes a close flyby of asteroid 951-Gaspra on October 29, 1991, and, depending on propellant availability and other factors, there may be a second asteroid flyby of 243-Ida on August 28, 1993. Upon arrival at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, the Galileo Orbiter will relay data back to Earth from an atmospheric Probe which is released five months earlier. For about 75 min, data is transmitted to the Orbiter from the Probe as it descends on a parachute to a pressure depth of 20-30 bars in the Jovian atmosphere. Shortly after the end of Probe relay, the Orbiter ignites its rocket motor to insert into orbit about Jupiter. The orbital phase of the mission, referred to as the satellite tour, lasts nearly two years, during which time Galileo will complete 10 orbits about Jupiter. On each of these orbits, there will be a close encounter with one of the three outermost Galilean satellites (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). The gravity assist from each satellite is designed to target the spacecraft to the next encounter with minimal expenditure of propellant. The nominal mission is scheduled to end in October 1997 when the Orbiter enters Jupiter's magnetotail. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

@article{Wagner2015,
abstract = {A combination of multiple gravity-assist and impulsive Delta-V maneuvers is often required for interplanetary and interstellar space missions, such as NASA's Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, and Cassini missions. The design of such complex interplanetary missions is difficult with traditional mission analysis techniques because the mission must be prepruned to determine potential trajectories. Prepruning has been necessary because these mission often require the optimization of dozens of variables in a highly nonlinear and discontinuous design space. This process risks pruning nonintuitive solutions, which may potentially contain the optimal trajectory. In this paper, a hybrid optimization algorithm that is capable of determining optimal interplanetary trajectories, including the number of gravity assists and the planetary flyby order, is developed. The hybrid optimization algorithm uses a stochastic genetic algorithm to globally search the design space, as well as traditional nonlinear programming gradient-based optimization tools to determine locally optimal trajectories. By combining the global convergence properties of genetic algorithms with the accuracy of gradient-based solvers, a robust optimization algorithm capable of determining near-optimal solutions for a complex interplanetary space mission is developed.},

abstract = {Planning an interplanetary trajectory is a very complex task, traditionally accomplished by domain experts using computer-aided design tools. Recent advances in trajectory optimization allow automation of part of the trajectory design but have yet to provide an efficient way to select promising planetary encounter sequences. In this work, we present a heuristic-free approach to automated trajectory planning (including the encounter sequence planning) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We discuss a number of modifications to traditional MCTS unique to the domain of interplanetary trajectory planning and provide results on the Rosetta and Cassini-Huygens interplanetary mission design problems. The resulting heuristic-free method is found to be orders of magnitude more efficient with respect to a standard tree search with heuristic-based pruning which is the current state-of-the art in this domain.},

@article{Alibay2014,
abstract = {Visited only by Voyager 2 in 1989, Neptune and its moon Triton hold important clues to the formation and evolution of the solar system and exoplanetary systems. Neptune-sized planets are the most commonly discovered exoplanets to date. Neptune, an ice giant, is theorized to have migrated from its formation location in the early solar system. This migration affects the expected interior structure, composition, and dynamical evolution of the planet. Triton is conjectured to be a heavily-processed, captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), a remnant from the early solar nebula and unique in our solar system. Triton may possess a subsurface aqueous ocean, making it an important astrobiological target. The 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey [1] identified a number of high priority science goals for the Neptunian system, including understanding the structure, composition, and dynamics of Neptune's atmosphere and magnetosphere, as well as surveying the surface of Triton. Following these guidelines, we present a low cost flyby mission concept to Neptune and Triton: TRIDENT (Taking Remote and In-situ Data to Explore Neptune and Triton). TRIDENT would carry six instruments and a government furnished atmospheric probe and would provide significant improvements over the scientific measurements undertaken by Voyager 2. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {A procedure to produce a large variety of trajectories to Uranus and Neptune is presented. A small set of exceptional trajectories emerges from this broad search and expands the range of missions available to these planets. Payload mass increases dramatically when a Jupiter flyby is available, and the choice of gravity-assist sequence has a greater effect on performance than the choice of propulsion system. The combination of solar electric propulsion and gravity assists enable missions with larger payloads than with chemical propulsion over a broad range of flight times and power levels. Results are provided for both aerocapture and chemical orbit insertion. Copyright 2009 California Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Europa is one of the most scientifically intriguing targets in planetary science due to its potential suitability for extant life. As such, NASA has funded the California Institute of Technology Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to jointly determine and develop the best mission concept to explore Europa in the near future. The result of nearly 4 years of work-the Europa Clipper mission concept-is a multiple Europa flyby mission that could efficiently execute a number of high caliber science investigations to meet Europa science priorities specified in the 2011 NRC Decadal Survey, and is capable of providing reconnaissance data to maximize the probability of both a safe landing and access to surface material of high scientific value for a future Europa lander. This paper will focus on a major enabling component for this mission concept-the trajectory. A representative trajectory, referred to as 13F7-A21, would obtain global-regional coverage of Europa via a complex network of 45 flybys over the course of 3.5 years while also mitigating the effects of the harsh Jovian radiation environment. In addition, 5 Ganymede and 9 Callisto flybys would be used to manipulate the trajectory relative to Europa. The tour would reach a maximum Jovicentric inclination of 20.1°, have a deterministic $\Delta$V of 164 m/s (post periapsis raise maneuver), and a total ionizing dose of 2.8 Mrad (Si).},
