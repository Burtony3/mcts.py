abstract = {In the design of multitarget interplanetary missions, there are always many options available, making it often impractical to optimize in detail each transfer trajectory in a preliminary search phase. Fast and accurate estimation methods for optimal transfers are thus of great value. In this paper, deep feed-forward neural networks are employed to estimate solutions to three types of optimization problems: the transfer time of time-optimal low-thrust transfers, fuel consumption of fuel-optimal low-thrust transfers, and the total dv of minimum-dv J2-perturbed multi-impulse transfers. To generate the training data, low-thrust trajectories are optimized using the indirect method and J2-perturbed multi-impulse trajectories are optimized using J2 homotopy and particle swarm optimization. The hyper-parameters of our deep networks are searched by grid search, random search, and the tree-structured Parzen estimators approach. Results show that deep networks are capable of estimating the final mass or time of optimal transfers with extremely high accuracy; resulting into a mean relative error of less than 0.5{\%} for low-thrust transfers and less than 4{\%} for multi-impulse transfers. Our results are also compared with other off-the-shelf machine-learning algorithms and investigated with respect to their capability of predicting cases well outside of the training data.},

@article{Jiang2012,
abstract = {This paper concerns the application of the homotopic approach, which solves the fuel-optimal problem of low-thrust trajectory by starting from the related and easier energy-optimal problem. To this end, some effective techniques are presented to reduce the computational time and increase the probability of finding the globally optimal solution. First, the optimal control problem is made homogeneous to the Lagrange multipliers by multiplying the performance index by a positive unknown factor. Hence, normalization is applicable to restrict the unknown multipliers on a unit hypersphere. Second, the switching function's first- and second-order derivatives with respect to time are derived to detect switching. The switching detection is embedded in the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with fixed step size to ensure integration accuracy for bang-bang control. Third, combined with the techniques of normalization and switching detection, the particle swarm optimization with well-chosen parameters considerably increases the probability of finding the approximate initial values of the globally optimal solution. Moreover, intermediate gravity assist, which brings complex inner constraints, is considered. To determine the approximate gravity assist date, analytical formulas are presented to evaluate the minimal maneuver impulse based on the results of Lambert problems. The first-order necessary conditions for gravity assist constraints are derived analytically. The optimal solution can be rapidly obtained by applying the techniques presented to solve the shooting function. The unknowns are far less than with direct methods, and the computational effort is also far lower. Two examples of fuel-optimal rendezvous problems from the Earth directly to Venus and from the Earth to Jupiter via Mars gravity assist are given to substantiate the perfect efficiency of these techniques.},

abstract = {The mission design to a halo orbit around the libration points from Earth involves two important steps. In the first step, we design a halo orbit for a specified size and in the second step, we obtain an optimal transfer trajectory design to the halo orbit from an Earth parking orbit. Conventionally, the preliminary design for these steps is obtained using higher order analytical solution and the dynamical systems theory respectively. Refinements of the design are carried out using gradient based methods such as differential correction and pseudo arc length continuation method under the of circular restricted three body model. In this paper, alternative single level schemes are developed for both of these steps based on differential evolution, an evolutionary optimization technique. The differential evolution based scheme for halo orbit design produces precise halo orbit design avoiding the refinement steps. Further, in this approach, prior knowledge of higher order analytical solutions for the halo orbit design is not needed. The differential evolution based scheme for the transfer trajectory, identifies the precise location on the halo orbit that needs minimum energy for insertion and avoids exploration of multiple points. The need of a close guess is removed because the present scheme operates on a set of bounds for the unknowns. The constraint on the closest approach altitude from Earth is handled through objective function. The use of these schemes as the design and analysis tools within the of circular restricted three body model is demonstrated through case studies for missions to the first libration point of Sun–Earth system.},

@article{Olds2007,
abstract = {Global optimization methods have been increasingly under consideration for preliminary interplanetary mission design. One promising global method, differential evolution, has been identified as being particularly well suited to high-thrust trajectory optimization. Differential evolution is a stochastic direct search optimization method which uses parameter vectors that interact in a manner motivated by the evolution of living species. To improve the performance of differential evolution for this application, the effect of the tuning parameters is investigated over a diverse group of trajectory optimization problems. The quality of solutions obtained with differential evolution is found to be very sensitive to the selection of the routine's tuning parameters. A set of tuning parameter values is found that results in the rapid global optimization of an array of typical ballistic interplanetary missions. The fine-tuned differential evolution routine is implemented in a new tool, the mission-direct trajectory optimization program, and the effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated by the rapid solution of interplanetary trajectory optimization problems that involve complex features such as multiple gravity assists and parking orbit considerations.

@article{Zhuang2014,
abstract = {A hybrid algorithm combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with the Legendre pseudospectral method (LPM) is proposed for solving time-optimal trajectory planning problem of underactuated spacecrafts. At the beginning phase of the searching process, an initialization generator is constructed by the PSO algorithm due to its strong global searching ability and robustness to random initial values, however, PSO algorithm has a disadvantage that its convergence rate around the global optimum is slow. Then, when the change in fitness function is smaller than a predefined value, the searching algorithm is switched to the LPM to accelerate the searching process. Thus, with the obtained solutions by the PSO algorithm as a set of proper initial guesses, the hybrid algorithm can find a global optimum more quickly and accurately. 200 Monte Carlo simulations results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid PSO-LPM algorithm has greater advantages in terms of global searching capability and convergence rate than both single PSO algorithm and LPM algorithm. Moreover, the PSO-LPM algorithm is also robust to random initial values. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAA.},

abstract = {Games are often designed to shape player behavior in a desired way; however, it can be unclear how design decisions affect the space of behaviors in a game. Designers usually explore this space through human playtesting, which can be time-consuming and of limited effectiveness in exhausting the space of possible behaviors. In this paper, we propose the use of automated planning agents to simulate humans of varying skill levels to generate game playthroughs. Metrics can then be gathered from these playthroughs to evaluate the current game design and identify its potential flaws. We demonstrate this technique in two games: the popular word game Scrabble and a collectible card game of our own design named Cardonomicon. Using these case studies, we show how using simulated agents to model humans of varying skill levels allows us to extract metrics to describe game balance (in the case of Scrabble) and highlight potential design flaws (in the case of Cardonomicon).},

abstract = {The Kuiper Belt is considered to be formed by remnants of the original Solar System, that is why exploration missions to that region are susceptible of having an enormous scientific impact. Nonetheless, it is far away from Earth, missions to KBO targets a significant challenge. Additionally, current methods to identify trajec- tories that encounter multiple KBOs are computationally intensive with impractically long run times on the order of months. The present work deals with applying a rapid low-fidelity technique to identify candidate preliminary KBO sequences, to be used as a starting point for future mission designers to identify trajectories to multiple KBOs. This pathfinding approach uses two consecutive grid search types. First, a well-tuned grid search is implemented using Lambert arcs to reach a first KBO, including the introduc- tion of a new, systematic approach to identify the step sizes in target-body arrival date for the Lambert-based grid search. Then, second and third KBO encounters are assessed from the results of the first grid search and second KBO search respectively. Both second and third KBO searches are performed with a new algorithm consisting of a time grid along with STM linear propagation for maneuver calculation. Finally, an example trajectory resulting from this technique that encounters two KBOs is given as a potential flyable route.},

In this method, firstly find the possible multiple gravity assist planet sequences with pruning based BFS and use standard differential evolution algorithm to judge the possibility of all the possible trajectories. Then select the better ones from all the possible solutions.

Recent advances in trajectory optimization allow automation of part of the trajectory design but have yet to provide an efficient way to select promising planetary encounter sequences. In this work, we present a heuristic-free approach to automated trajectory planning (including the encounter sequence planning) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We discuss a number of modifications to traditional MCTS unique to the domain of interplanetary trajectory planning and provide results on the Rosetta and Cassini-Huygens interplanetary mission design problems.

@article{Wagner2015,
abstract = {A combination of multiple gravity-assist and impulsive Delta-V maneuvers is often required for interplanetary and interstellar space missions, such as NASA's Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, and Cassini missions. The design of such complex interplanetary missions is difficult with traditional mission analysis techniques because the mission must be prepruned to determine potential trajectories. Prepruning has been necessary because these mission often require the optimization of dozens of variables in a highly nonlinear and discontinuous design space. This process risks pruning nonintuitive solutions, which may potentially contain the optimal trajectory. In this paper, a hybrid optimization algorithm that is capable of determining optimal interplanetary trajectories, including the number of gravity assists and the planetary flyby order, is developed. The hybrid optimization algorithm uses a stochastic genetic algorithm to globally search the design space, as well as traditional nonlinear programming gradient-based optimization tools to determine locally optimal trajectories. By combining the global convergence properties of genetic algorithms with the accuracy of gradient-based solvers, a robust optimization algorithm capable of determining near-optimal solutions for a complex interplanetary space mission is developed.},

This paper will focus on a major enabling component for this mission concept-the trajectory. A representative trajectory, referred to as 13F7-A21, would obtain global-regional coverage of Europa via a complex network of 45 flybys over the course of 3.5 years while also mitigating the effects of the harsh Jovian radiation environment. In addition, 5 Ganymede and 9 Callisto flybys would be used to manipulate the trajectory relative to Europa.

abstract = {The Galileo spacecraft was launched by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989. A two-stage Inertial Upper Stage propelled Galileo out of Earth parking orbit to begin its 6-year interplanetary transfer to Jupiter. Galileo has already received two gravity assists: from Venus on February 10, 1990 and from Earth on December 8, 1990. After a second gravity-assist flyby of Earth on December 8, 1992, Galileo will have achieved the energy necessary to reach Jupiter. Galileo's interplanetary trajectory includes a close flyby of asteroid 951-Gaspra on October 29, 1991, and, depending on propellant availability and other factors, there may be a second asteroid flyby of 243-Ida on August 28, 1993. Upon arrival at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, the Galileo Orbiter will relay data back to Earth from an atmospheric Probe which is released five months earlier. For about 75 min, data is transmitted to the Orbiter from the Probe as it descends on a parachute to a pressure depth of 20-30 bars in the Jovian atmosphere. Shortly after the end of Probe relay, the Orbiter ignites its rocket motor to insert into orbit about Jupiter. The orbital phase of the mission, referred to as the satellite tour, lasts nearly two years, during which time Galileo will complete 10 orbits about Jupiter. On each of these orbits, there will be a close encounter with one of the three outermost Galilean satellites (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). The gravity assist from each satellite is designed to target the spacecraft to the next encounter with minimal expenditure of propellant. The nominal mission is scheduled to end in October 1997 when the Orbiter enters Jupiter's magnetotail. {\textcopyright} 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Neptune-sized planets are the most commonly discovered exoplanets to date. Neptune, an ice giant, is theorized to have migrated from its formation location in the early solar system. This migration affects the expected interior structure, composition, and dynamical evolution of the planet. Triton is conjectured to be a heavily-processed, captured Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), a remnant from the early solar nebula and unique in our solar system. Triton may possess a subsurface aqueous ocean, making it an important astrobiological target. The 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey [1] identified a number of high priority science goals for the Neptunian system, including understanding the structure, composition, and dynamics of Neptune's atmosphere and magnetosphere, as well as surveying the surface of Triton. Following these guidelines, we present a low cost flyby mission concept to Neptune and Triton: TRIDENT (Taking Remote and In-situ Data to Explore Neptune and Triton).

Payload mass increases dramatically when a Jupiter flyby is available, and the choice of gravity-assist sequence has a greater effect on performance than the choice of propulsion system. The combination of solar electric propulsion and gravity assists enable missions with larger payloads than with chemical propulsion over a broad range of flight times and power levels. Results are provided for both aerocapture and chemical orbit insertion. Copyright 2009 California Institute of Technology.},
